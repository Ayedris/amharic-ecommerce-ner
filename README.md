# Amharic E-commerce Data Extractor for FinTech Insights

This project is part of the 10Academy Week 4 AI Mastery Challenge (June 18â€“24, 2025). The goal is to develop a system for extracting structured insights from Telegram-based e-commerce channels in Amharic, enabling EthioMart to centralize listings and evaluate vendors for micro-lending opportunities.

## Project Objectives

- Scrape and preprocess Amharic messages from Telegram e-commerce channels.
- Label data using CoNLL format for NER.
- Fine-tune transformer-based NER models (XLM-R, Amharic-BERT, etc.).
- Compare models using metrics like F1-score and interpretability tools (SHAP, LIME).
- Score vendors using extracted data and Telegram metadata for loan eligibility.
